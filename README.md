#### Important Files

The project folder contains two other folders:

1. Static

	As the name suggests, it contains files containing all the relevant js and css.	

2. Backend

	Contains php files for crunching data from the excel worksheet.

###### Dependencies
The js files use Rickshaw (https://github.com/shutterstock/rickshaw), D3 (https://github.com/mbostock/d3) and JQuery. 
Some of the functionality required changes to the core Rickshaw library, hence the modified 
library is now under version control. Future enhancements would focus on changing back to having the core library not 
under version control and only the additions under version control.
